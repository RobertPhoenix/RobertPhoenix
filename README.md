Hi, I’m Robert Wilkinson. I’m interested in anything to do with automation, either hardware or software.

I'm a software engineer building applications using .Net, C# and Angular. 

However my hobby projects up until now have been using Arduino, but I'm now also working with Raspberry Pi Pico.

I'm interested in animation, DCC and LocoNet.
